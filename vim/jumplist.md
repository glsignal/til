Vim keeps a history of jumps stored, and these can be cycled through using ^I / ^O

> A "jump" is one of the following commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n",
> "N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and
> the commands that start editing a new file.

See `:help jumplist` for for information
